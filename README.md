# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website showcases my skills, projects, and experience. The website is built using React and Next.js, providing a smooth and responsive user experience. The entire website is designed as a single-page application, resembling a one-page resume.

You can access the website <a href="https://www.hassanattar.com">here</a>.

## Features

- **React and Next.js:** The website is built using React and Next.js.

- **JSON Data Management:** All the data presented on the website is managed using JSON files. This approach eliminates the need for a database and simplifies the data handling process. The data file is only read at build-time and then cached on the server.

- **Type Safety with TypeScript:** TypeScript is used to ensure type safety throughout the project. This enhances code quality and helps prevent runtime errors by catching type-related issues during development.

- **CSS Modules:** Styling is implemented using CSS Modules, which allows for scoped styling and prevents class name collisions. This approach keeps the styling organized and maintainable.

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Each section of the website is componentized, enabling seamless integration and easy maintenance. This modular approach makes it simple to update or expand individual sections without affecting the entire website.

- **Sentry for Monitoring and Statistics:** This website will get a log of the client errors for debugging purposes and to make sure that the visitors will have an error free experience.
